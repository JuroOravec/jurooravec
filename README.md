Open source fam, ~7 yrs of web dev (Vue / React), language-agnostic. Been at [BenevolentAI](https://www.benevolent.com/), [Exponea](https://www.benevolent.com/), currently freelancing at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/).

<!-- Too smart to build dashboards. Too independent to work in FAANG. -->

Since 2024, my open source goals are to:

- Bring Vue and Vuetify to Python
- Modernize web dev experience for Django
- Speed up server-side Vue with Rust.

I'm basically reimplementing Vue design (slots, composition, etc) in Python. If it can run in Python, it could be also ported to Go or Rust. And with that we could have something like Nuxt.js, where you would have Vue files, but they would contain extra `<server></server>` section, and this server section would run in Go/Rust.

My projects (highlights):

- [django-components](https://github.com/django-components/django-components) (Co-author) - Most powerful Vue-like frontend framework for Django
  - Planning to make it framework-agnostic in 2026.
- [Alpinui](https://github.com/JuroOravec/alpinui) - Vuetify port for Python
- [alpine-composition](https://github.com/JuroOravec/alpinui/tree/main/packages/alpine-composition) - Vue's Composition API in AlpineJS
- [alpine-reactivity](https://github.com/JuroOravec/alpinui/tree/main/packages/alpine-reactivity) - Vue's Reactivity API in AlpineJS

Along the way I contribute to projects across the Python / Django web dev stack:

- [selectolax](https://github.com/rushter/selectolax)
- [airspeed-velocity](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv)
- [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
